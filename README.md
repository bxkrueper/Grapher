# Grapher
This is a basic graphing program made using Java Swing. You can type in math functions and assign values to variables on the right.

The GameEngine, Function, and MyAlgs folders are other eclipse projects that this project needs on its build path.

Run the executable jar file to start the program: once you are in the directory in the command prompt, type the following line

java -jar Grapher.jar
